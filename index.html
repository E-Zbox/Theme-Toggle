                    <p>Can you imagine life without lights, fans, cars, computers, television or fetching water from wells and rivers? Energy is needed in all walks of life. Most of the energy on the earth comes from the Sun in the form of sun rays. The Sun's rays are required so that plants can make food. In order to live all the animals in the world depend on the food produced by plants. Animals and human beings utilize the energy found in food to operate their bodies and muscles</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Energy can exist in many forms and the different forms make different things happen. As well as heat, light and sound, there are other forms such as chemical energy, kinetic energy and potential energy.
                        Sound energy travels as waves. We hear sounds when the waves make our eardrums vibrate. <br><img src="" alt='sound energy illustration'> <br>
                        Chemical energy is energy that is released during chemical reactions. Food and fuels, such as coal, oil and petrol, as well as batteries, 
                        are stores of chemical energy.<br><img src="" alt="chemical energy illustration"/><br>
                        Moving objects have kinetic energy, the energy of movement. The faster something moves, the more kinetic energy it has. As it slows down, it loses kinetic energy. <br><img src="" alt="kinetic energy illustration"><br>
                        Potential energy is the energy an object has because of its position in a force field, such as a field of gravity or magnetism, such as elastic and springs, have potential strain or elastic energy.

                        <h3>Energy conversion</h3>
                        <p>The law of conservation of energy states that energy can never be created or destroyed. Whenever anything happens and energy is used, it is converted into a different form.
                            <br><img src="" alt="energy conversion illustration"><br>
                            An "energy chain" is a useful way of showing how energy is converted from one form to another. <br><img src="" alt="energy conversion illustration 02"><br>
                            The final forms in most energy chains are heat and light. Even this energy is not lost, but it spreads out into the environment and is very difficult to harness for any useful purpose

                        <h3>Solar Energy</h3>
                        <p>Solar energy is the kind of energy which comes from sunlight in the form of heat. It can be used to generate electricity. With help of mirrors and lenses, solar energy can be made powerful enough to heat water or even melt metals.

                        <h3>Energy resources</h3>
                        <p>We need energy to heat and light houses, to cook food and provide the power for factories and cars. The energy can be obtained by burning fuels, or by other methods such as hydroelectric power.
                            Wood, coal, oil and natural gas are called non-renewable fuels because they can only be used once. Other sources of energy, such as the Sun, wind and water, are called <em>Renewable Energy</em> resources
                            because they generate power withou themselves being used. <img src="" alt="renewable energy illustration"><br>
                            Coal, oil and natural gas are called fossil fuels because they formed from the fossilized remains of plants or animals. About 20 percent of the world's energy come from coal. When fossil fuels burn, they release
                            carbon dioxide and other gases into the air and they are partly to blame for problems such as acid rain and the greenhouse effect.

                        <h3>Measuring energy and Power</h3>
                        <p>Energy is normally measured in very small units called joules (J). A thousand joules is a kilojoule (kJ)
                            <br><img src="" alt="energy and power illustration"><br>
                            Power is the energy used in a certain time and it is measured in units called <em>watts</em> (W). One watt is equal
                            to one joule per second. The more energy a machine or appliance produces in a certain period of time the more energy dissipitated.

                        <p>Machines and appliances take one form of energy, for example, electricity, and change into another form of energy. Machines are described as efficient if they change most of the energy that is used to power them, into useful form of energy that is needed.</p>
